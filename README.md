scripts i've made to do things easier for me

Imguralbumdownloader is a script i made for me to easily start downloading 500+ wallpapers at once instead of waiting for imgur to compress the pictures and then make it download able.

Irssi screen picker, is just a small script with a menu to have my irc servers in a nice and neat place... haven't had time to setup irssi to connect to several screens at once...(im a bit lazy, at the time and this works nice, so think i just keep on using this :3)
